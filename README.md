# ISBN Number
AIM:

Create a program that will verify if a string is a valid ISBN number (see requirements below).
Use a TDD approach.

This is a big exercise - break it down into chunks!

REQUIREMENTS FOR ISBN

ISBN-10 is made up of 9 digits plus a check digit (which
may be 'X') and ISBN-13 is made up of 12 digits plus a
check digit. Spaces and hyphens may be included in a code,
but are not significant. This means that 9780471486480 is
equivalent to 978-0-471-48648-0 and 978 0 471 48648 0.
The check digit for ISBN-10 is calculated by multiplying
each digit by its position (i.e., 1 x 1st digit, 2 x 2nd
digit, etc.), summing these products together and taking
modulo 11 of the result (with 'X' being used if the result
is 10).
The check digit for ISBN-13 is calculated by multiplying
each digit alternately by 1 or 3 (i.e., 1 x 1st digit,
3 x 2nd digit, 1 x 3rd digit, 3 x 4th digit, etc.), summing
these products together, taking modulo 10 of the result
and subtracting this value from 10, and then taking the
modulo 10 of the result again to produce a single digit.

Examples of valid ISBN-13:
"9780470059029"
"978-0-13-149505-0"
"978 0 471 48648 0"
Examples of valid ISBN-10:
"0471958697"
"0-321-14653-0"
"877195869x"
Examples of invalid ISBNs:

Example of how the ISBN-10 sumcheck is calculated:
first 9 digits of an isbn10: 742139476
create checksum:
sum = 1*7 + 2*4 + 3*2 + 4*1 + 5*3 + 6*9 7*4 + 8*7 + 9*6
sum = 7 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 15 + 54 + 28 + 56 + 54
sum = 232
checksum = 232%11
checksum = 1
isbn = 7421394761
